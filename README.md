# Summary

Upon updating the new scores it was found in the District Analysis that there was less than a 0.5% change which didn't change the school, or student count, there wasn't an impact in Top School Rankings. No major changes were found there due to Thomas High School being a Charter School. Scores by school size, and type were not impacted enough to make a change in the original findings. It is my recommendation in the future to avoid running additional analysis that schools have the proper rules, and regulation in place when testing. This will save time, and unnecessary spending.
